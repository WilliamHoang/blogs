PhotoDrop
=========

One of the cool features of Couchbase Lite that hasnâ€™t been featured much is an ability to do P2P replication between two devices on the same local network. Couchbase Lite is packaged with an extra component called `Couchbase Lite Listener` that allows your application to accept HTTP connections from other devices running Couchbase Lite and exchange data with them in either push or pull direction.

A couple months ago, Wayne Carter and Traun Leyden skyped me in and sold me an idea about creating a simple P2P photo sharing app that can demonstrate how easily we can develop a P2P application by using Couchbase Lite. I was engaged  since then and spent a couple days working on this little P2P iOS photo sharing app, and I called it `PhotoDrop`. In this blog post, I will show you how I use Couchbase Lite to develop the application.

Overview
--------
`PhotoDrop` is a P2P photo sharing app similar to the iOS `AirDrop` feature that we can use to send photos across Apple devices. Before jumping straight to the code, I would like to briefly discuss the concerns and design choices that were made when developing the application.

**Peer Discovery** can be done in several ways. In iOS, we can use the `Bonjour Service` for discovering peers but this could be an issue for later when we want to develop the application in other platforms. In PhotoDrop, we are using a simpler and more direct way, which is using the `QRCode`. We use the QRCode to advertise an adhoc endpoint URL that a sender can scan and send photos to.

**Peer Identity** is a related subject to the Peer Discovery. Peer Identiy is normally difficult to solve without introducing undesired steps into the application such as user registration, user login, and peer approval. With QRCode, the issue is mitigated by the expicit scanning action that two people need to have iniatiated in order to send and receive the photos.

**Authentication** is needed to ensure that the access control, for this case the WRITE access to push photos into another peer's database, is granted to the right person. In PhotoDrop, we are using the Basic Auth that Couchbase Lite Listener has already supported. We securely generate a one-time username and password, bundle them together with the URL endpoint and then encode them all into a QRCode to be presented by a receiver to a sender. Once the sender scans the QRCode, the sender will have the username and password ready to perform the basic authentication, which is already done automatically and seamlessly by Couchbase Lite.

**Secure Channel** is required especially for sending sensitive information. We are not yet implementing the secure communication feature. However, recently Jen Alfke added a SSL support including an API to generate a self-signed certificate on the fly to the iOS Couchbase Lite Listener. As all the hard work has been done, we could add support for this feature pretty easily.

After all, the current flow of the PhotoDrop is fairly simple. You select photos you want to share to your friend and open the QRCode scanner to scan the target endpoint that the photo will be sent to. For the receiver on the another side, your friend opens the application, shows up the QRCode and waits for you to scan and send the photos. The next section will provide all the implementation details of the application.

Selecting photos
----------------
`PhotoDrop` uses ALAssetsLibrary to access to the photos in the Camera Roll album on an iOS device instead of using the UIImagePickerViewController that doesn't support multiple photo selection.

```Swift
	// ViewController.swift

	// MARK: - ALAssetsLibrary
    func reloadAssets() {
        if library == nil {
            library = ALAssetsLibrary()
        }

        assets.removeAll(keepCapacity: true)
        library.enumerateGroupsWithTypes(ALAssetsGroupSavedPhotos, usingBlock:
            { (group:ALAssetsGroup!, stop:UnsafeMutablePointer<ObjCBool>) -> Void in
                if group != nil {
                    group.setAssetsFilter(ALAssetsFilter.allPhotos())
                    group.enumerateAssetsWithOptions(NSEnumerationOptions.Reverse,
                        usingBlock: { (asset:ALAsset!, index:Int,
                            stop: UnsafeMutablePointer<ObjCBool>) -> Void in
                            if asset != nil {
                                self.assets.append(asset)
                            }
                    })
                } else {
                    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), {
                        self.collectionView.reloadData()
                    })
                }
            }) { (error:NSError!) -> Void in
        }
    }
```
The photo assets are displayed in a UICollectionViewController. A simple custom UICollectionViewCell named `PhotoViewCell` is created to display a photo thumbnail and a checkbox indicating the selecting status of the photo.

```Swift
	// ViewController.swift

	// MARK: - UICollectionView
    func collectionView(collectionView: UICollectionView,
        cellForItemAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) -> UICollectionViewCell {
        let cell = collectionView.dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifier("photoCell",
            forIndexPath: indexPath) as PhotoViewCell
        let asset = assets[indexPath.row]
        cell.imageView.image = UIImage(CGImage: asset.thumbnail().takeUnretainedValue())
        cell.checked = contains(selectedAssets, asset)
        return cell
    }

    func collectionView(collectionView: UICollectionView,
        didSelectItemAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) {
        let cell = collectionView.cellForItemAtIndexPath(indexPath) as PhotoViewCell
        let asset = assets[indexPath.row]
        if let foundIndex = find(selectedAssets, asset) {
            selectedAssets.removeAtIndex(foundIndex)
            cell.checked = false
        } else {
            selectedAssets.append(asset)
            cell.checked = true
        }
        collectionView.reloadItemsAtIndexPaths([indexPath])

        self.enableSendMode(selectedAssets.count > 0)
    }
```

Sending photos
--------------
When the selected photos are ready to send as the send button is touched, the SendViewController will be presented and set with the selected photos.

```Swift
	// ViewController.swift

    override func prepareForSegue(segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: AnyObject?) {
        if segue.identifier == "send" {
            let navigationController = segue.destinationViewController as UINavigationController
            let controller = navigationController.topViewController as SendViewController
            controller.sharedAssets = selectedAssets
        }
    }
```
Upon the SendViewController is presented, we find ourselves in the viewDidLoad() function in which we get an empty database object named "db" from the `DatabaseUtil` class. The reason that we get a freash database as to ensure that there are no pending documents from a previous sharing session.

```Swift
	// SendViewController.swift

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        var error: NSError?
        database = DatabaseUtil.getEmptyDatabase("db", error: &error)
        if error != nil {
            AppDelegate.showMessage("Cannot get a database with error : \(error!.code)", title: "Error")
        }
    }
```
The getEmptyDatabase() function of the DatabaseUtil class is ensure to return an empty database with the given name by deleting the database if it does exist and recreating a new one.

```Swift
	// DatabaseUtil.swift

	class func getEmptyDatabase(name: String!, error: NSErrorPointer) -> CBLDatabase? {
        if let database = CBLManager.sharedInstance().existingDatabaseNamed(name, error: nil) {
            if !database.deleteDatabase(error) {
                return nil;
            }
        }
        return CBLManager.sharedInstance().databaseNamed(name, error: error)
    }
```
Once the SendViewController is presented, we will be at the viewDidAppear(animated:Bool) function. At the viewDidAppear function, we start the AVFoundation's QRCode capturing session to present the QRCode scanner.

```Swift
	// SendViewController.swift

	override func viewDidAppear(animated: Bool) {
        super.viewDidAppear(animated)

        if database != nil && session == nil {
            startCaptureSession()
        }
    }

	func startCaptureSession() {
        let app = UIApplication.sharedApplication().delegate as AppDelegate

        let device = AVCaptureDevice.defaultDeviceWithMediaType(AVMediaTypeVideo)
        if device == nil {
            AppDelegate.showMessage("No video capture devices found", title: "")
            return
        }

        var error: NSError?
        let input = AVCaptureDeviceInput.deviceInputWithDevice(device, error: &error)
            as AVCaptureDeviceInput
        if error == nil {
            session = AVCaptureSession()
            session.addInput(input)
            let output = AVCaptureMetadataOutput()
            output.setMetadataObjectsDelegate(self, queue: dispatch_get_main_queue())
            session.addOutput(output)
            output.metadataObjectTypes = [AVMetadataObjectTypeQRCode]

            previewLayer = AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer.layerWithSession(session)
                as AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer
            previewLayer.videoGravity = AVLayerVideoGravityResizeAspectFill
            previewLayer.frame = self.previewView.bounds
            self.previewView.layer.addSublayer(previewLayer)

            session.startRunning()
        } else {
            AppDelegate.showMessage("Cannot start QRCode capture session", title: "Error")
        }
    }
```
When a QRCode is captured, we extract the endpoint URL which is the remote URL that we will send the photo documents to. The core code for creating and sending photo documents begins and ends just right here in the replicate(url: NSURL) function which has about 50 lines of code.

The code starts with looping thru each photo in the sharedAssets array. For each photo, we get a binary representation and attach to an empty `Couchbase Lite` document created correspondingly.

```Swift
	// SendViewController.swift

	func replicate(url: NSURL) {
        self.previewView.hidden = true;
        self.statusLabel.text = "Sending Photos ..."
        UIApplication.sharedApplication().networkActivityIndicatorVisible = true

        var docIds: [String] = []
        for asset in sharedAssets! {
            let representation = asset.defaultRepresentation()
            var bufferSize = UInt(Int(representation.size()))
            var buffer = UnsafeMutablePointer<UInt8>(malloc(bufferSize))
            var buffered = representation.getBytes(buffer, fromOffset: 0,
                length: Int(representation.size()), error: nil)
            var data = NSData(bytesNoCopy: buffer, length: buffered, freeWhenDone: true)

            var error: NSError?
            let doc = database.createDocument()
            let rev = doc.newRevision()
            rev.setAttachmentNamed("photo", withContentType: "application/octet-stream", content: data)
            let saved = rev.save(&error)

            if saved != nil {
                docIds.append(doc.documentID)
            }
        }
		...
    }
```
After we finish creating the documents as above code snippet, we are now going to send those documents with photo attached to the other device. We create a push replicator and set the ids of the documents that we would like to replicate over to the other device. In general, setting the document ids to a replicator is optional in which the replicator will just replicate all of the documents in the database.

Before we start the replicator, we setup a notification observer to observe the replicating status so that we can display replication status appropriately when the replication is started and done.

```Swift
	// SendViewController.swift

	func replicate(url: NSURL) {
    	...
		if docIds.count > 0 {
            replicator = database.createPushReplication(url)
            replicator.documentIDs = docIds

            NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().addObserverForName(kCBLReplicationChangeNotification,
                object: replicator, queue: nil) { (notification) -> Void in
                    if self.replicator.lastError == nil {
                        var totalCount = self.replicator.changesCount
                        var completedCount = self.replicator.completedChangesCount
                        if completedCount > 0 && completedCount == totalCount {
                            self.statusLabel.text = "Sending Completed"
                            UIApplication.sharedApplication().networkActivityIndicatorVisible = false
                        }
                    } else {
                        self.statusLabel.text = "Sending Abort"
                        UIApplication.sharedApplication().networkActivityIndicatorVisible = false
                    }
            }
            replicator.start()
        }
	}
```

Receiving photos
----------------

Receiving photos is done in `ReceiveViewController` which is presented from the ViewController screen when a user touches the Receive button. When the ReceiveViewController is presented, at viewDidLoad() method, similarly to the `SendViewController`, we get a fresh database named "db". At the viewDidAppear(animated: Bool) function, we call startListener() to create and start a `CBLListener` object. The `CBLListener` is an embedded lightweight HTTP server which listens to HTTP requests and routes those requests to appropriate handlers to perform replicating operations. Once the listener is successfully started, we can obtain the listener's URL and present a QRCode encoding the URL. We are lucky that the iOS CoreImage supports a QRCode filter so that we could generate a QRCode image in very less effort.

```Swift
	// ReceiveViewController.swift

	override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        collectionView.hidden = true;

        var error: NSError?
        database = DatabaseUtil.getEmptyDatabase("db", error: &error)
        if error != nil {
            AppDelegate.showMessage("Cannot get a database with error : \(error!.code)", title: "Error")
        }
    }

    override func viewDidAppear(animated: Bool) {
        super.viewDidAppear(animated)

        if database == nil {
            return;
        }

        if (!startListener()) {
            AppDelegate.showMessage("Cannot start listener", title: "Error")
            return;
        }

        if syncUrl != nil {
            imageView.image = UIImage.qrCodeImageForString(syncUrl.absoluteString,
                size: imageView.frame.size)
        }
    }

	// MARK: - Listener
    func startListener() -> Bool {
        if listener != nil {
            return true
        }

        var error: NSError?
        listener = CBLListener(manager: CBLManager.sharedInstance(), port: 0)

		// Enable Basic Authentication
        listener.requiresAuth = true
        let username = secureGenerateKey(NSCharacterSet.URLUserAllowedCharacterSet())
        let password = secureGenerateKey(NSCharacterSet.URLPasswordAllowedCharacterSet())
        listener.setPasswords([username : password])

        var success = listener.start(&error)
        if success {
            // Set a sync url with the generated username and password:
            if let url = NSURL(string: database.name, relativeToURL: listener.URL) {
                if let urlComp = NSURLComponents(string: url.absoluteString!) {
                    urlComp.user = username
                    urlComp.password = password
                    syncUrl = urlComp.URL
                }
            }

            // Start observing for database changes:
            startObserveDatabaseChange()
            return true
        } else {
            listener = nil
            return false
        }
    }
```

When we setup the listener from the above startListener() function, we also enable the Basic Authentication with a generated paired username and password. The generated username/password pair serves as a one-time password that can provide us a secure solution preventing unauthorized users who may keep watching for the url and push some documents to the receiver. To generate a username and password, we use the iOS Randomization Services API (SecRandomCopyBytes) that can generate cryptographically secure random numbers.

```Swift
	func secureGenerateKey(allowedCharacters: NSCharacterSet) -> String {
        let data = NSMutableData(length:32)!
        SecRandomCopyBytes(kSecRandomDefault, 32, UnsafeMutablePointer<UInt8>(data.mutableBytes))
        let key = data.base64EncodedStringWithOptions(
            NSDataBase64EncodingOptions.Encoding64CharacterLineLength)
        return key.stringByAddingPercentEncodingWithAllowedCharacters(allowedCharacters)!
    }
```

At the end of the startListener() function, the startObserveDatabaseChange() function is called to observe any changes happening to the database via notifications named `kCBLDatabaseChangeNotification`. We are now able to know when the photo documents from the other device are replicated so that we could save the photos into the device's camera roll accordingly.

```Swift
	// ReceiveViewController.swift

	// MARK: - Database Change
    func startObserveDatabaseChange() {
        NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().addObserverForName(kCBLDatabaseChangeNotification,
            object: database, queue: nil) {
                (notification) -> Void in
                if let changes = notification.userInfo!["changes"] as? [CBLDatabaseChange] {
                    for change in changes {
                        dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), {
                            if self.collectionView.hidden {
                                self.collectionView.hidden = false
                            }
                            self.saveImageFromDocument(change.documentID)
                        })
                    }
                }
        }
    }
```

The function to save a photo into to the device's camera roll is as below. The function simply gets the image from the attachment of the document, creates an CGImage representation and saves to the camera roll album via the ALAssetsLibrary's writeImageDataToSavedPhotosAlbum() function. After saving a photo, we display the thumbnail version of the photo on the screen.

```Swift
	// ReceiveViewController.swift

	func saveImageFromDocument(docId: String) {
        let app = UIApplication.sharedApplication().delegate as AppDelegate
        if let doc = app.database.existingDocumentWithID(docId) {
            if doc.currentRevision.attachments.count > 0 {
                let attachment = doc.currentRevision.attachments[0] as CBLAttachment
                if let image = UIImage(data: attachment.content)?.CGImage {
                    let library = assetsLibrary()
                    library.writeImageDataToSavedPhotosAlbum(attachment.content, metadata: nil,
                        completionBlock: { (url: NSURL!, error: NSError!) -> Void in
                        if url != nil {
                            library.assetForURL(url, resultBlock:
                                {(asset: ALAsset!) -> Void in
                                    self.assets.insert(asset, atIndex: 0)
                                    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), {
                                        self.collectionView.insertItemsAtIndexPaths(
                                            [NSIndexPath(forRow: 0, inSection: 0)])
                                    })
                                })
                                {(error: NSError!) -> Void in
                            }
                        }
                    })
                }
            }
        }
    }
```


Wrapping up
-----------

There are many ways to develop `PhotoDrop` app, and using `Couchbase Lite` is one way and perhaps one of the easiest ways to do it. The core code for sending and receiving photos is barely 100 lines of code and contains zero lines of code directly involving network or HTTP communication. I hope this blog post and PhotoDrop application itself could give you some inspiration and ideas to use Couchbase Lite to develop your P2P applications. Clone the [PhotoDrop](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/PhotoDrop-iOS) GitHub repo and play with it yourself. Let us know what you think.
